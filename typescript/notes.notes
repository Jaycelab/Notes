- Typescript Notes: 
- Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. 
- Type annotations are optional in TypeScript because the TypeScript compiler can infer the type of a variable based on its value. An example of this is when you declare a variable and assign it a value, the TypeScript compiler will infer the type of the variable based on the value you assigned to it.
