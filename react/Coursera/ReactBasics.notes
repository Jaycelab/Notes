- Just like you can use expressions inside function components, you can also use them as prop values inside JSX elements, when rendering those function components.
- Importing an image is possible in React by first importing the image file and then creating a component that uses the image as a prop. We do this by passing the image as a prop to the component by creating a variable with the src as the image file and returning the variable.
We can then use the component in the App page or main app page. 
- In React, you need to import a component multiple times – as many times as you plan to render it from its parent’s return statement. False 
You should import the component only once, and then you’re allowed to render it as many times as needed
-  You can render as many of the same component, or as many different components as you like, from the parent component.
